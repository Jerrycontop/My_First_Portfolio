        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name Jerry, I am aspiring web developer and this is my first portfolio I am creating using html.</p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>I'm learning frontend technologies like html, css, and JavaScript. I'm also exploring Git, GitHub, and web design principles.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>One of my first major milestones was completing a set of JavaScript tasks, including variables, loops, and conditionals.</p>
        <p>I also pushed my code to GitHub and began understanding version control, which helps me track and manage my codebase better.</p>
        <p>With each project, Iâ€™m improving my problem-solving skills and getting more confident in my ability to build useful applications.</p>
